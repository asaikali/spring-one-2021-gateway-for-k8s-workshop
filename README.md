```

2. check that kind cli is installed using `kind version` this workshop is tested with `kind v0.10.0 go1.15.7 darwin/amd64` newer versions will work older versions might not. 

3. check the kubectl version installed using `kubectl version` this workshop is tested with version 1.20.2 of the cli as shown from output 

```text
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"20", GitVersion:"v1.20.2", GitCommit:"faecb196815e248d3ecfb03c680a4507229c2a56", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2021-01-14T05:14:17Z", GoVersion:"go1.15.6", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"darwin/amd64"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"19+", GitVersion:"v1.19.7-gke.1500", GitCommit:"99f90aac4943d3d1c8d9705458c2711240fcfc2b", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2021-02-03T09:17:28Z", GoVersion:"go1.15.5b5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```

4. check the version of helm you have installed using the command `helm version` this workshop has been tested with `version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.5.0",GitCommit:"32c22239423b3b4ba6706d450bd044baffdcf9e6", GitTreeState:"dirty", GoVersion:"go1.15.6"}` earlier versions might not work.

## Create kind cluster

1. Create a k8s 1.20.2 cluster using the command `kind create cluster --name scgw --config cluster.yml` you should see output similar to the one below 

```text
Creating cluster "scgw" ...
 ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.20.2) üñº 
 ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶ üì¶  
 ‚úì Writing configuration üìú 
 ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è 
 ‚úì Installing CNI üîå 
 ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ 
 ‚úì Joining worker nodes üöú 
Set kubectl context to "kind-scgw"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-scgw

Thanks for using kind! üòä
```

2. execute the command `kubectl get nodes` you should get the output showing a 
control plane and worker node.  

```text
NAME                 STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
scgw-control-plane   Ready    control-plane,master   70s   v1.20.2
scgw-worker          Ready    <none>                 34s   v1.20.2
```

## Download Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes 

1. Download the [Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes from Tanzu Net](https://network.pivotal.io/products/spring-cloud-gateway-for-kubernetes). This workshop
is tested with version 1.0.0 so make sure to download 1.0.x release. 

1. Extract the downloaded tar.gz file `tar zxf spring-cloud-gateway-k8s-1.0.0.tgz` you will find the files shown below.
```text
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ helm
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ spring-cloud-gateway-1.0.0.tgz
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gateway-1.0.0.tar
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scg-operator-1.0.0.tar
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ install-spring-cloud-gateway.sh
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ relocate-images.sh

3 directories, 5 files
```
3. Inspect the contents of the `images` folder. Notice it contains two container images packaged as `.tar` files. 
   the script located in `scripts/relocate-images.sh` is used to publish `gateway-1.0.0.tar` and 
   `scg-operator-1.0.0.tar` images into a private container registry accessible from the kubernetes cluster you 
   deploy the spring cloud gateway on. In this workshop we will provide you with a container registry that already has 
   the spring cloud gateway containers available.  

4. Inspect the `helm` chart folder and notice that it contains a gzipped helm chart. This will 
   be used to install the spring cloud gateway operator. 
   
5. Inspect the `scripts` folder notice that it contains two shell scripts, one for publishing the private 
   container images to a registry, and the second scripts runs a helm to install the operator. 

## Install Spring Cloud Gateway Operator

1. create a namespace to install spring cloud gateway into using the command `kubectl create namespace spring-cloud-gateway`

1. We are using a private container registry, so we must create a kubernetes secret in the spring-cloud-gateway 
   namespace. Grab the password for the container registry from the workshop Slack channel then modify the command
   below with the password and execute it. 

```text
kubectl create secret docker-registry spring-cloud-gateway-image-pull-secret -n spring-cloud-gateway \
--docker-server=registry.harbor.demo.tanzufun.com/tanzu \
--docker-username=workshop \
--docker-password=[replace with password from workshop]
```

1. In the `helm` folder create a file called `scg-image-values.yaml` with the content below
```yaml
gateway:
  image: "registry.harbor.demo.tanzufun.com/tanzu/gateway:1.0.0"
scg-operator:
  image: "registry.harbor.demo.tanzufun.com/tanzu/scg-operator:1.0.0"
```
this file is normally generated when the `scripts/relocate-images.sh` is run but since we did not run the script we
are creating so that the helm chart can install spring cloud gateway. 

1. Execute `./scripts/install-spring-cloud-gateway.sh` you should see output similar to below 
```text
Installing Spring Cloud Gateway...
chart tarball: spring-cloud-gateway-1.0.0.tgz
chart name: spring-cloud-gateway
Release "spring-cloud-gateway" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: spring-cloud-gateway
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Mar  4 00:47:20 2021
NAMESPACE: spring-cloud-gateway
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
This chart contains the Kubernetes operator for Spring Cloud Gateway.
Install the chart spring-cloud-gateway-crds before installing this chart
Finished installing Spring Cloud Gateway
```

1. execute the command  `kubectl get all -n spring-cloud-gateway` you should see a pod running the spring cloud gateway 
operator as shown below. 
   
```text
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/scg-operator-679f77dbb-8w9bt   1/1     Running   0          3m42s

NAME                   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/scg-operator   ClusterIP   10.96.32.243   <none>        80/TCP    3m42s

NAME                           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/scg-operator   1/1     1            1           3m42s

NAME                                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/scg-operator-679f77dbb   1         1         1       3m42s
```

1. The spring cloud gateway operator installed three kubernetes custom resources definitions. Execute the command 
   `kubectl get crds` and you will see all the created custom CRDs shown below. These CRDs will be used to configure 
   the gateway. 
   
```text
 NAME                                              CREATED AT
springcloudgatewaymappings.tanzu.vmware.com       2021-03-04T05:47:20Z
springcloudgatewayrouteconfigs.tanzu.vmware.com   2021-03-04T05:47:20Z
springcloudgateways.tanzu.vmware.com              2021-03-04T05:47:20Z
```

## Define a gateway instance 

1. Inspect the `demo/my-gateway.yml` file it contains the YAML shown below which defines 
a spring cloud gateway instance.
   
```yaml
apiVersion: "tanzu.vmware.com/v1"
kind: SpringCloudGateway
metadata:
  name: my-gateway
```

2. Execute the command `kubectl apply -f demo/my-gateway.yml` which will submit a request to the cluster
to deploy an instance of spring cloud gateway. 

3. execute the command `kubectl get all` you should see a pod of the spring cloud gateway running
or being launched in the cluster's default namespace as shown in the output below.
   
```text
NAME               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/my-gateway-0   1/1     Running   0          3m36s

NAME                          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/kubernetes            ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP    3h12m
service/my-gateway            ClusterIP   10.96.178.167   <none>        80/TCP     3m36s
service/my-gateway-headless   ClusterIP   None            <none>        5701/TCP   3m36s

NAME                          READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/my-gateway   1/1     3m36s
```

4. Inspect the file `demo/route-config.yml` it contains gateway configuration CRD that proxies requests
set the gateway to github. Notice that this route configuration is generic.  

```yaml
apiVersion: "tanzu.vmware.com/v1"
kind: SpringCloudGatewayRouteConfig
metadata:
  name: my-gateway-routes
spec:
  routes:
    - uri: https://github.com
      predicates:
        - Path=/**
      filters:
        - StripPrefix=1
```

5. run the command `kubectl apply -f demo/route-config.yml` you 

6. Inspect the file `demo/mapping.yml` notice that it points at the gateway instance we already deployed
at the configuration defined in `route-config.yml`
```yaml
apiVersion: "tanzu.vmware.com/v1"
kind: SpringCloudGatewayMapping
metadata:
  name: test-gateway-mapping
spec:
  gatewayRef:
    name: my-gateway
  routeConfigRef:
    name: my-gateway-routes
```

7. run the command `kubectl apply -f demo/mapping.yml` this will configure the already deployed 
   instance to pass proxy requests to github.com 
   
8. We don't have a load balancer configured with our kind cluster, so we will use port forwarding to
   test the gateway. run the command `kubectl port-forward service/my-gateway 8080:80` you will see 
   output like
```text
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8080
```

9. Using a browser go to `http://locahost:8080` you should see the github site. The request are 
   going to spring cloud gateway which is then sending them to github.com. Congrats you have 
   managed to deploy a spring cloud gateway instance using a CRD. There are many more things
   that you can do with spring cloud gateway that we will discuss in the rest of the workshop this is 
   just the start.
